                <p>Lanka Software Foundation (LSF) is a non-profit company (limited by guarantee) founded in 2003 by Dr. Sanjiva Weerawarana and Mr. Jivaka Weeratunge. Along with Sanjiva and Jivaka, the other subscribers of the company are Dr. Indrajith Coomaraswamy, Dr. Kamal Weeraperuma, Mr. Ralph de Lanerole, Prof. Saman Amarasinghe, Mr. Paul Ratnayeke, Prof. Kumar Wickramasinghe and Dr. Yohan Weerasuriya, and the late Prof. V.K. Samaranayake.</p>
                <p>In the first 15 years, LSF focused on providing a platform for Sri Lankan software engineers to create open source software technology that would impact the world of software. LSF has been very successful in that regard: we have created a brand for Sri Lanka as a country that produces a lot of open source software by becoming a leading contributor to the Apache Software Foundation (the leading open source community in the world), by creating the Sahana disaster management system after the 2004 tsunami (which is now its own US-based foundation: Sahana Software Foundation) and various other projects.</p>
                <p>LSF has always been funded by grants from various organizations, both in Sri Lanka and outside.</p>
                <p>In August 2018, LSF changed course from creating technology to helping the Government of Sri Lanka deploy technology to improve governance and the quality of services provided to citizens. This project is called Code for Sri Lanka.</p>
